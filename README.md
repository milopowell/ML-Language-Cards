# ML-Language-Cards

Through this project, users will be able to use ML to assist in their langauge learning abilities

Often, language learning apps don't help students in specific scenarios.

In this app, students can choose or create their own scenario to learn specific phrases and vocabulary in their target language.

For example, a native English user learning French can request phrases and vocabulary about how to get a haircut in France. 

This app will help bridge the gap between theoretic language learning and practical language learning that users can use as they travel around the world.
